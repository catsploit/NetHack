# NetHack
An open source project developed for the 'PenTesting' and tests of 'exploits'.

## How is it written?
NetHack is an open source tool, anyone can access its internal structure and understand what is behind because of how simple the code is. Not to mention that this is written in Python, a language of easy compression and syntax

### Why NetHack?
NetHack, as described in the previous paragraph, has an easy to understand syntax. Both as easy-to-use tools and a comfortable and understandable user interface.

## NetHack package-manager
NetHack thought about teamwork and expanding the tool based on the user's tastes.

For problems as such we think *How to expand the community?* and in that *__NetHack package-manager__* emerged. A tool in development that will allow the user to write their own extensions to upload them to a public server of easy access, where the user can **manage** packages and create their own

***That and much more for the comfort of the user, remembering that our strength is teamwork***
